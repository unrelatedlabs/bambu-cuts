# Bambu Cuts - Cutter and Plotter for Bambu Lab Printers

Control your Bambu Lab 3D printer as a CNC cutter or plotter. Convert SVG/DXF files to G-code and execute them with a web-based control interface.


# WARNING

This can brake your printer, or you, or your cat, or all of the above. Especially if you put a knife on your printer. Using this software there will be no hard limits of the printer movements, make sure your gcode is reasonable. 


The origin of the print is at the current tool head position for X and Y. 
The Z=0 is set with the jogger, always make sure the Z is correctly zeroes. Otherwise it can plunge the knife into the print bed.

The printer needs to be in LAN mode with developer options enabled, or run an older firmware (1.0.4 worked for me)

## TLDR
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/unrelatedlabs/bambu-cuts.git
   bambucuts server
   ```

## Assembling the cutter 

![Cutter Assembly](docs/cutter_crosssection.jpeg)

Print in PETG! PLA tends to creep more. 

Parts: 
 - 2mm ID 6mm OD 3mm deep bearing 2x. https://amzn.to/46W4Ju7
 - roland style 2mm shaft blades https://amzn.to/4gY9w2Q 
 - 7mm OD, 20mm long spring https://amzn.to/4mQEISK
 - 1.7mm diameter 13mm long steel rod. (I cut a nail to size)
 - a small magnet to hold the blade. I've attached it on the clamp after the cutter is mounted on the printer. 


 The cutter assembly fits in the place of the hot end. Insert to a piece of filament to control the spring tension with the extruder.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unrelatedlabs/bambu-cuts.git
cd bambu-cuts
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Without Installing (Development)

**Quick Start (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**Manual Setup:**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server directly
python -m bambucuts.webui.app
```

Open http://localhost:5425 in your browser.

### Option 2: Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t bambucuts .

# Run the container (interactive for first-time config)
docker run -it -p 5425:5425 bambucuts

# Or run with existing config (non-interactive)
docker run -p 5425:5425 -v ~/.bambucuts.conf:/root/.bambucuts.conf bambucuts
```

**Note:** Use `-it` flag on first run to interactively enter printer configuration. After configuration is saved, you can mount the config file with `-v` flag for subsequent runs.

Open http://localhost:5425 in your browser.

### Option 3: Install and Use CLI

After installation with `pip install -e .`:

```bash
bambucuts server
```

On first run, you'll be prompted for your printer configuration. Configuration is saved to `~/.bambucuts.conf`

Open http://localhost:5425 in your browser.

### 3. Convert SVG to G-code

```bash
bambucuts svg2gcode input.svg -o output.gcode
```

### 4. Convert DXF to SVG

```bash
bambucuts dxf2svg input.dxf -o output.svg
```

## CLI Commands

- `bambucuts server` - Start web interface
- `bambucuts svg2gcode INPUT` - Convert SVG to G-code
- `bambucuts dxf2svg INPUT` - Convert DXF to SVG
- `bambucuts mqtt-dump` - Dump raw Bambu MQTT printer report messages

Run `bambucuts --help` for full options.

## Debugging printer MQTT reports

To inspect the raw status payload from the printer:

```bash
bambucuts mqtt-dump --seconds 5 --count 5
```

The terminal output prints each report as it arrives. To keep listening:

```bash
bambucuts mqtt-dump --follow
```

For machine-readable live output:

```bash
bambucuts mqtt-dump --follow --ndjson
```

When the web server is running, the same dump is also available at:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5425/api/mqtt-dump?seconds=5&count=5"
```

For streaming newline-delimited JSON:

```bash
curl -N "http://localhost:5425/api/mqtt-stream?seconds=60&count=0"
```

## G-code progress over MQTT

`M73 P<percent> R<remaining>` updates the printer's MQTT progress fields, such as `mc_percent` and `mc_remaining_time`.

When G-code is sent from the web UI, Bambu Cuts injects progress markers after batches of commands:

```gcode
M400
M73 P32 R8
```

`M400` waits for queued motion to finish before the `M73` marker runs, so seeing the matching `mc_percent` and `mc_remaining_time` pair in MQTT means the printer has completed the previous batch.

For `Print Direct`, the web UI tracks the active direct job separately. The send action only means the G-code was queued; execution is considered done when MQTT reports the exact final `M73 P... R...` checkpoint for that job. Checkpoint values are chosen so each marker changes and the first/final checkpoint do not reuse the cached stale MQTT value.

## My process 

- Create SVG in Inkscape
- create gcode in Kiri:Moto https://grid.space/kiri/  The machine settings for Kiri:Moto are at examples/kirimoto_settings.- I check my gcode with https://ncviewer.com
- In the webui set Z=0 with the jogger
- Move the print head to where the bottom left of the image is supposed to start.
- Load gcode in webui 
- Print 3mf
